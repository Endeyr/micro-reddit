# README

Micro-Reddit app created by following The Odin Project and Railstutorial.org.

"This application includes examples of all the major features of Rails, including models, views, controllers, templates, partials, filters, validations, callbacks, has_many/belongs_to and has_many :through associations, security, testing, and deployment."

This project taught me many lessons and brought tons of challenges. I felt much more familiar with sql and heroku by building this app. I also feel much stronger in my understanding of MVC - Model / Views / Controller as I needed to build the app following that format.
